Selected Business Challenge is : **Cargo Shipment Management**

__Goal__: Our goal was to scan the image for dimension and compute volume with other basic options for any cargo like - stackable, Tiltable etc.

__Approach__:
We have used very fast and simple analytical apprach to find the dimensions from images taken using Android mobile app and then process the image to find 
Length, Breadth and Height on backend.

Our app will provide the GUI for all the communications and method will be clear through UI .

__Languages used__: Python , Android.
